## Flowchart Explanation

The flowchart provides a visual representation of how the system processes incoming emails. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial Email**:
    - The process begins when an email is received by the system.

2. **Categorize the Email**:
    - The system categorizes the email based on its content. This involves checking for specific keywords and patterns to determine the type of the email.

3. **Inquiry Handling**:
    - **Check if it's an Inquiry**:
        - The system checks if the email is an inquiry about the availability or rental prices of equipment.
        - **YES**: If the email is an inquiry:
            - **Check Item Availability**: The system queries the SQLite database to check the availability of the requested item.
            - **Generate Response**: The system generates a response based on the item's availability and rental price.
        - **NO**: If the email is not an inquiry, the system proceeds to the next check.

4. **Review Handling**:
    - **Check if it's a Review**:
        - The system checks if the email is a review.
        - **YES**: If the email is a review:
            - **Check if it's a Positive Review**: The system analyzes the sentiment of the review.
                - **YES**: If the review is positive:
                    - **Generate Response with Positive and Thankful Tone**: The system generates a positive and thankful response, encouraging the customer to share their experience on social media.
                - **NO**: If the review is negative:
                    - **Generate Response with Supportive Way and Gift Voucher**: The system generates a supportive response and offers a gift voucher to compensate for the negative experience.
        - **NO**: If the email is not a review, the system proceeds to the next check.

5. **Assistance Request Handling**:
    - **Check if it's an Assistance Request**:
        - The system checks if the email is a request for assistance or troubleshooting help.
        - **YES**: If the email is an assistance request:
            - **Use Groq RAG Pipeline**: The system uses the Groq RAG pipeline to generate a response. This involves sending the email content to the Groq API and retrieving a generated solution.
            - **Generate Response**: The system generates a response based on the solution provided by the Groq RAG pipeline.
        - **NO**: If the email is not an assistance request, the system forwards the email to customer service for manual handling.

6. **General Handling**:
    - **Forward to Customer Service**:
        - Emails that do not fit into any of the above categories are forwarded to customer service for further evaluation and response.
